All contributions to 1Bitsy are welcome. Whether you want to scratch an itch, or simply contribute to the project, feel free to pick something from the [roadmap]({{< relref "meta/roadmap.md" >}}) or contact [esden](http://esden.net/) about what may make sense to do next.

You should fork the applicable repository of the project and make your changes.  *We encourage pull requests to discuss code and hardware design changes.*

When you're ready to create a pull request, be sure to:

  * Have tested your changes.  If you have questions about how to do it, please ask in your pull request.
  * Squash your commits into a single commit.  `git rebase -i`.  It's okay to force update your pull request.
