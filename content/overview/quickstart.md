# Quickstart on the command line

It is ultra easy to get going with 1Bitsy and Black Magic Probe. You need only
minimal amounts of software.

* gcc-arm-embedded toolchain
* libopencm3
* some firmware code to play with

# Quickstart using PlatformIO

We have made a fully self contained download of PlatformIO that is pre
configured for the use with the 1Bitsy platform.
